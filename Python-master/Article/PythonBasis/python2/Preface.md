# Foreword #

I have recently started a new project and my work has become busy again, but I still have to make time every day to write a blog, but it is impossible to do daily updates, because a blog takes a long time to write. [Gitbook](https://www.readwithu.com/) will be updated at the same time.

Note: Seeing the hypocritical words before, I immediately wanted to delete them. You can just press the delete button to find out. After deleting, I don't know what to write. It was revoked instantly. Many things have been changed in this chapter, and many examples have been added.
