# One. Brief description of Python syntax #

Each language has its own grammar, whether it is a natural language (English, Chinese) or a computer programming language.

Python is no exception. It also has its own grammatical rules, and the editor or parser converts the program code that conforms to the grammar into machine code that the CPU can execute, and then executes it.

Python's syntax is relatively simple, using indentation.

As in the code screenshot above, the statement beginning with # is a comment, and every other line is a statement. When the statement ends with a colon:, the indented statement is regarded as a code block.

It should be noted that Python programs are case sensitive. If you write a wrong case, the program will report an error.
