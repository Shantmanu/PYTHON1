# Three, the first Python program #

Okay, having said so much, now we can write our first Python program.

At the beginning of writing a Python program, I don’t recommend using a special tool to write it. It’s not convenient to be familiar with the grammar, so I’ll use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) to write it first, and it can be changed later. Use PyCharm.

The first Python program is of course to print Hello Python.

If you have no programming experience and don’t understand anything, it’s okay. Just follow along and make an impression on your first Python program. Just give it a try.

Create a new file and name it `HelloPython.py`. Note that this is a file with the suffix `.py`.

Then open the file and type `print('Hello Python')`

Finally, you can open a command line window, switch the current directory to the directory where HelloPython.py is located, and you can run the program. The following is the result of the run.

Of course, if you use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and configure the environment variables when installing Python, you can run it directly by pressing Ctrl + B. The results are as follows:
