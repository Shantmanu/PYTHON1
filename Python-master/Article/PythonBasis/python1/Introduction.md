# One. Introduction to Python #

Python is a programming language written by the famous "Uncle Turtle" Guido van Rossum during Christmas 1989 to pass the boring Christmas. A great man is a great man. In order to pass the boring time, he wrote a programming language that is so boastful.

Now, there are almost 600 programming languages ​​in the world, but there are only about 20 popular programming languages. I wonder if you have ever heard of the TIOBE ranking.

This is the TOP20 list of programming languages ​​in February 2017:

There is also the trend of the Top 10 programming language TIOBE index:

In general, these programming languages ​​have their own merits, but it is not difficult to see that Python has developed very fast in recent years, especially the recent popular machine learning and data analysis, allowing Python to develop rapidly.

Python is a high-level programming language, and one of its characteristics is rapid development. Python provides us with a very complete basic code library, covering a large amount of content such as the network, files, GUI, database, text, etc., which is vividly called "batteries included". Developed in Python, many functions do not need to be written from scratch, just use the ready-made ones. And Python can also develop websites. Many large websites are developed with Python, such as YouTube, Instagram, and domestic Douban. Many large companies, including Google, Yahoo, etc., and even NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) use Python extensively.

Of course, any programming language has its advantages and disadvantages, and Python is no exception. So what are the disadvantages of Python?

The first disadvantage is that it runs slowly, which is very slow compared to C programs. Because Python is an interpreted language, your code will be translated line by line into machine code that the CPU can understand during execution. This translation process is very time-consuming. So very slow. The C program is directly compiled into machine code that can be executed by the CPU before running, so it is very fast.

The second disadvantage is that the code cannot be encrypted. If you want to publish your Python program, you are actually publishing the source code. Compiled languages ​​like JAVA and C do not have this problem, while interpreted languages ​​must release their source code.
